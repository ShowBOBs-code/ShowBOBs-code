# 👋 Hi, I'm Rishi

I'm a beginner programmer currently studying data science and building the skills to become a quant researcher.  
I’m passionate about coding, financial markets, and solving complex problems using math and data.

### 🚀 What I’m Doing Right Now
- Learning Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OOP)
- Practicing algorithms & data structures on LeetCode
- Studying statistics, probability, and linear algebra
- Reading about trading strategies and quant finance
- Building my first backtesting and data analysis projects

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (So Far)
- **Languages:** Python (primary), SQL (beginner)
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub, VSCode
- **Topics I'm Exploring:**  
  - Quant strategies (momentum, mean reversion)  
  - Sharpe ratio, volatility, expected return  
  - Real-time data from APIs

### 📈 Projects (WIP)
- 🧪 **Simple Backtester** – Simulating moving average crossover strategies  
- 📊 **Volatility Visualizer** – Analyzing asset volatility using market data  
- 🧠 **LeetCode Log** – Tracking my DSA progress and problem-solving journey  
- More coming soon...
